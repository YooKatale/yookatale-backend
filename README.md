****Request for Discussion:****

Hello YooKatale,

I am rewriting to inform you that I believe I can successfully implement the last requirement. But to ensure a smooth implementation process and address any questions or concerns, I'd like to propose an open meeting to discuss the technical details and the integration of the new feature. This meeting will also provide an opportunity to align everyone's expectations and gather any additional input that might be beneficial for the implementation.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting, and we can coordinate a suitable time to discuss this further.

Looking forward to your response and the opportunity to enhance our application with this exciting new feature.

****IMPREMENTED WORK SOFAR (In development branch)****

**Step 1: Created a New API Endpoint**

Open the file where the order-related API endpoints are defined (In controller.js), and This code was added:

**Step 2: Updated the Order Model**
Open the file where Order model is defined (Order.model.js), and Tt include the trackingInfo field:

**Step 3: Update the Order Creation Process**

Whenever a new order is created,It should include the initial tracking information. This can be done where you create a new order in your createNewOrderPost function:

**STEPS TO TAKE IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THIS FEATURE**

**Modify Order Model:**

In your existing Order model, add a new field called trackingInfo. This field will be an array to store the tracking information for the order. Each entry in this array will have properties such as status (to indicate the order's progress) and timestamp (to record the time of the status update).

**Order Creation:**

When a new order is created, initialize the trackingInfo field with an initial status like "Order placed" and the current timestamp. You can do this while creating a new order object before saving it to the database.

**Order Status Updates:**

As the order progresses through various stages (processing, shipped, delivered, etc.), you'll need to update the trackingInfo array with new status entries and timestamps. This can be done whenever the order status changes.

**Retrieve Tracking Information:**

Create a new endpoint in your backend to fetch the order tracking information based on the order's ID. This endpoint will query the database to retrieve the order by its ID and return the trackingInfo field.

**Frontend Integration:**

On the frontend, when a user wants to track their order, they can provide the order ID. You can then make a request to the backend's tracking information endpoint using this order ID. Once you receive the tracking information, you can display it to the user, showing the status changes and timestamps.

**User Experience:**

Consider how you want to present the tracking information to the user. You might use a timeline view, a progress bar, or a series of status updates with timestamps.

**Authentication:**

Ensure that the tracking information is only accessible to authorized users. You can use authentication middleware to validate user sessions before providing tracking details.

**Security:**

Keep in mind that the tracking information should not reveal sensitive data about the order or the customer. Only provide information that is relevant for tracking the order's progress.

**Testing:**

Thoroughly test the order tracking feature to ensure it works as expected. Test different scenarios such as order creation, status updates, and retrieval of tracking information.

**Documentation:**

Update your API documentation to include information about the new order tracking endpoint and how to use it.
